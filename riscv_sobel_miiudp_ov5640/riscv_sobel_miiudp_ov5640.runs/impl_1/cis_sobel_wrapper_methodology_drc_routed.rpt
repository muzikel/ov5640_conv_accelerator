Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 23 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint. First endpoint covered by the constraint: cis_sobel_i/wr_ddr_fifo_1/inst/wr_ddr3_fifo/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gcx.clkx/rd_pntr_cdc_inst/dest_graysync_ff_reg[0][0]/D

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
